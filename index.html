        <p> <blockquote> <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>I am Willie Rosh Adajar, born on June 15, 2005, and raised in our peaceful province of Oriental
            Mindoro with my loving mother and brother.<sup>2</sup> The place where all things started.<sup>3</sup> Growing up in the province with my brother was an adventure filled with simple joys and cherished memories.<sup>4</sup> While our other siblings chased their dreams in the busy city, we embraced the freedom of our
            rural surroundings.<sup>5</sup> My childhood was warm, laughter-filled, and full of so many happy memories.<sup>6</sup> I was raised surrounded by family and friends, enjoying simple pleasures like playing under the sun, running in fields, and swimming in nearby rivers.<sup>7</sup> The province was so vibrant
            and full of adventure - climbing trees and enjoying local festivals with loved ones. <sup>8</sup>The bond I shared with my mother and the friendships I built made my early years truly special, shapingme into the person I am today. <sup>9</sup> Childhood memories in a small provincial town are often colored by the simplicity and joy of nature. <sup>10</sup>This enchanting environment provides a perfect backdropfor various activities that do not require gadgets or modern technology. <sup>11</sup>Instead, kids play old- school games and go on adventures that will be remembered for a lifetime. <sup>12</sup>Hide-and-seek, tag, and marbles fill the afternoons. <sup>13</sup>Groups of friends are laughing and strategizing as they play in the open fields or behind the tall grass. <sup>14</sup>Such games encourage children to be active andcreative because they come up with new rules or variations to keep the game going. <sup>15</sup>Enjoying things like there is no tomorrow. <sup>16</sup> Feels like it's my best day of my life everyday.<sup>17</sup> But somehow, feels sad. <sup>18</sup> Remembering your siblings and your dad working in abroad for you to get a brighter future.<sup>19</sup> And that makes me to be a kid with ambition. <sup>20</sup> Builts me and shapes me into the person I am today.

        <p><blockquote> <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>My teenage years were a time of pure freedom, where every day felt like an adventure waiting to happen.<sup>2</sup> My friends and I spent countless hours exploring new places, trying new things, and living in the moment without a single thought about the consequences.<sup>3</sup> We’d stay out late, laughing until our stomachs hurt, making memories that felt endless.<sup>4</sup> There were no real
            worries just the thrill of the present.<sup>5</sup> Whether it was, going on spontaneous road trips, or simply hanging out at the usual spot.<sup>6</sup> Talking about dreams we hadn't even figured out yet.<sup>7</sup> We believed we were invincible, that nothing could stop us.<sup>8</sup> And that growing up was somethingwe could put off forever.<sup>9</sup> There was no overthinking, no second-guessing just living.<sup>10</sup> Life was an easy thing because there was not a single thing that would require drama and have to be overcome by just bursting out laughing.<sup>11</sup> We trusted one another blindly to know that however
            things might fall, we shall always find how to have good fun.<sup>13</sup> Continuing high school life in the province.<sup>14</sup> Remembered being a student athlete during junior year in high school. <sup>15</sup> That makes me more motivated to continue doing good and maintaining my grade. <sup>16</sup> Slowly taking life seriously.<sup>17</sup> To maintain being an athlete till my senior year.<sup>18</sup> And finished my high school life with an honor and a student athlete in our school.<sup>19</sup> It all happens because of my very supporting mom and family.<sup>20</sup> Living my best life during high school.

            <sup>1</sup>Moving in the city after high school. <sup>2</sup> Facing the real life and world without any idea. <sup>3</sup>It's a rollercoaster ride of emotions, challenges, and realizations for me at the University of theEast.<sup>4</sup> This is the phase in my life where I have come to realize how important it is to takethings seriously.<sup>5</sup> When I started college, I thought it would just be an extension of high school.<sup>6</sup> But soon realized it was much more demanding.<sup>7</sup> It is not always fun to enjoy life at this point of life.<sup>8</sup> We need to take things seriously.<sup>9</sup> The work load is heavier, deadlines are stricter, and the
            expectations are higher.<sup>10</sup> There were times when I felt overwhelmed, but I learned to manage my time and prioritize my tasks.<sup>11</sup> Along the way, however, I lost some friends who opted for a
            different path, but also met new ones who steered me in the right track.<sup>12</sup> The new friendships have grown me both academically and otherwise.<sup>13</sup> My knowledge and skills have improved dramatically, especially regarding technology and its impact on society.<sup>14</sup> Professors have greatly played a part in my growth.<sup>15</sup> They taught me that IT is not just about coding but also about
            problem-solving and innovation.<sup>16</sup> I have had countless sleepless nights, especially during the deadlines of the projects and exams.<sup>17</sup> However, college is more than just academics.<sup>18</sup> It is a time for discovery, discovering who I am and what I want to do in the future.<sup>19</sup> I joined organizations that helped build my confidence and leadership skills.<sup>20</sup> There were days when I wanted to giveup, but I reminded myself why I started.<sup>21</sup> Every failure taught me a lesson, and every success motivated me to aim higher.<sup>22</sup> Balancing academics and personal life was challenging, but it
            made me more responsible.<sup>23</sup> This journey has transformed me into a stronger and more independent person.<sup>24</sup> It's no joke.<sup>25</sup> College life is a stepping stone toward my dreams, andit isvery crucial.<sup>26</sup> I have made up my mind to give this experience the best shot while continuingonthis journey.
